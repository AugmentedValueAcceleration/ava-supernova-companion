// Canonical capability × surface matrix — the single declared truth for
// "what works where". A doc page that `requires` a capability auto-hides on any
// surface that lacks it, and surface badges are derived from this table. So
// "the extension has no screenshot" is never written by hand — it's derived.
//
// Surfaces here are the *products* ('ext' | 'ide' | 'companion' | 'cli'). The
// public website ('web') is a superset: it shows every page regardless, with
// per-surface badges, so it is intentionally never listed as a gate below.
