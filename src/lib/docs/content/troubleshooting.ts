If it says "connecting", your provider (the AI service Ava is talking to) is reachable but slow — give it thirty seconds. If it says "unavailable", Ava auto-fell-back to the next model in the chain (she automatically switched to a backup model). If nothing at all, verify your API key in Settings and test the connection. (An API key is the private password that lets Ava use a paid AI service.)' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'What you see: one of Ava\'s steps (a "tool call" — her reading a file, running a command, and so on) shows a red error instead of finishing.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Click the failed tool call to see the error. Common causes: she tried to touch a file outside your project folder, which is blocked on purpose for your safety (this guard is called "path traversal" protection — it stops her wandering outside the folder you are working in); a command that needs to run in a different folder; or a file that got moved since Ava last looked at it. Tell her what went wrong — she will retry with corrections.' },

If the memory is definitely there but not surfacing, open the memory browser and search — if it is not there, it was never saved in the first place.' },

Then sign in again.' },
