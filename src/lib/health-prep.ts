/**
 * Where the cooking actually lands in a week.
 *
 * A meal plan tells you what to eat. It does not tell you that Tuesday needs
 * ninety minutes at the hob after work, that Thursday's dish had to be
 * marinating since Wednesday, or that you are about to cook the same chilli
 * three times when once would do. That is the difference between a plan that
 * survives a work week and one that gets abandoned on day three.
 *
 * ── Two columns this deliberately does NOT trust ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `batch_portions` looks like the obvious basis for batch cooking, and §2.6
 * specifies it. It cannot be used: 78% of versions in the library say exactly
 * 12, and 1,407 of them are exactly 3× their own default servings. A rolled
 * omelette, a toasted injera snack and a steak and ale pie all read
 * servings=4 / batch=12 / keeps=4 — identical. That is a seeded default, not a
 * judgement about the dish, and building on it would confidently tell someone
 * to make twelve portions of tamagoyaki.
 *
 * So batching is derived from THE PLAN instead: if the same recipe is on three
 * days inside its own fridge life, cooking it once is a fact provable from
 * what is already written down, and needs no such column.
 *
 * `total_time_minutes` is ELAPSED time, not effort — its maximum in the
 * library is 43,245 minutes (thirty days) on a recipe whose prep is 45
 * minutes. Summed as a day's workload it would claim a Tuesday needs seven
 * hundred hours. The gap between it and prep+cook is unattended waiting, which
 * is not a burden — it is a reason to start early, and is reported as one.
