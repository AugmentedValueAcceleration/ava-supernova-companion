/**
 * Turn a stretch of a meal plan into one shopping list.
 *
 * A meal plan that cannot be shopped is not a plan, it is a suggestion. This is
 * the step that makes the week executable: every meal in the range, every
 * ingredient line scaled to the servings actually planned, the same ingredient
 * collapsed into one row, and the rows walked in the order of a shop.
 *
 * Three rules it holds to, all of them learned the hard way elsewhere in this
 * feature:
 *
 *  - DERIVE, DON'T COPY. Ingredient quantities are stored exactly as the
 *    recipe wrote them, for the recipe's own default servings. Scaling happens
 *    here, at read time, so changing a meal's servings needs no rewrite of the
 *    stored plan and cannot leave a stale number behind.
 *
 *  - NEVER INVENT A CONVERSION. Grams and millilitres are summed separately,
 *    and a count ("2 cloves") is never silently turned into a weight. When an
 *    item arrives in two incompatible shapes the list says "400 g + 2 cloves"
 *    rather than guessing. A wrong quantity in a shop is worse than two.
 *
 *  - ABSENCE IS NOT ZERO. A meal whose ingredients were never captured is
 *    reported in `missing`, not quietly skipped. A short list that looks
 *    complete would send someone home without dinner.
